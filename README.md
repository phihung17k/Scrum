## Agile

##### Advantage

- Project follow a predefined schedule, predictable costs

- Clients have visibility of each phase 

- Greater interaction between project and team (something called daily scrum that 15 minutes meeting)

- Product output is predictable, sometime happen earlier than expected 

- High quality development, testing and collaboration is ensured

- The product backlog can be refined and re-prioritized

- The needs of customers can be focused on

##### Methodologies

- Scrum

- Kanban

- XP

- Lean

- Crystal

## Scrum

- Scrum is a framework that enable teams to work together

- With Scrum, teams can:
  
  - Learn from experiences
  
  - Self-organize working on problems
  
  - To reflect on their victories
  
  - And their losses to improve

##### Benifits

- Time and money are used efficiently

- Project are divided into smaller units called sprints

- Scrum meetings: daily speak about what have done, something will complete, something is pending and why

##### Scrum Team: 3 roles (different objective)

- Product Owner: responsible for maximizing the ROI (return on investment) by determining features, prioritizing it into a list, what needs for the next sprint, constantly reprioritizing and refining

- Scrum Master: help teams learn and apply scrum, remove impediments (like bottleneck), 

- Scrum Team

##### Scrum Artifacts

- Components of the Scrum process that improve transparency and understanding of the work, 3 artifacts used in process:
  
  - **Product Backlog**: consist of a list of
    
    - New features
    
    - Changes to the existed features bug fixes
    
    - Changes to the infrastructure and other activities
  
  - **Sprint Backlog**: 
    
    - A subset of the product backlog
    
    - Sprints refers to short periods of time during which a Scrum team aims to get a given amount of work done
    
    - Sprints help teams deliver working software regularly
    
    - Sprints could be between 1-4 weeks long
    
    - Sprint goal is the objective decided for sprint, an outcome of negotiations between Product Owner and team
    
    - Identify tasks from Product Backlog, add to Sprint Backlog

  - **Product Increment**:
    
    - Combination of all Product Backlog tasks completed in a sprint and value of increments of previous sprints
    
    - Product Increment have to **done** at the end of sprint

##### Scrum Framework

<img title="" src="https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/inline-images/2021-01/scrumorg-scrum-framework-3000.png" alt="" width="712">

- Product Backlog: a list of tasks to achieve  the goal

- Sprint Planning: determines the tasks from the product catalog, aim to deliver during the sprint

- Sprint Backlog: tasks discussed during script planning, are added to the sprint backlog

- Scrum Team: (usually 5-9 members) work on tasks in the sprint backlog

- Daily Scrum: 15-minute-long events where the team members plan what they aim to achieve in the next 24 hours, what is accomplished, what is discussed in previous daily scrum

- Increment: a workable output is given to stakeholders

- Sprint Review: happens when sprint is complete, involves team, scrum master, product owner and stakeholders. 
  
  - Team shows what is accomplished during the sprint, allows time to ask, feedback or suggestions
  
  - The product owner get feedback for upcoming sprints and about things relate to backlog

- Sprint Retrospective: identify the past mistakes, potential issues and new ways to handle them. Preparing data for the next sprint

##### Scrum Board

<img title="" src="https://www.zohowebstatic.com/sites/default/files/sprints/seo/sb-how-img2.webp" alt="" width="558">

- A  physical or virtual tool that helps tema to visualize items in the sprint backlog 

- It show all action items, keep the team focused to the tasks that need completion and their priority

- Divide into slots like To-do, In Progress and Done

- When new sprints are started, the existed board is reset, new scrum board is created
