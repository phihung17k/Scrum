### Scrum

- A lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems

- Requires a **Scrum Master** to promote an environment where
  
  1. **Product Owner** order the work into a **Product Backlog**
  
  2. **Scrum Team** turns a selection of the work into **Increment** of value during a **Sprint**
  
  3. **Scrum Team** and **stakeholders** inspect the results and adjust for the next **Sprint**
  
  4. *Repeat*

##### Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. 

- Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. 

- Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials

- An iterative approach to optimize predictability and control risk

- Transparency, inspection and adaptation

##### Scrum Values

5 values: 

- Commitment

- Focus

- Openess

- Respect

- Courage

##### Scrum Team

- The fundamental unit of Scrum

- Consist of a **Scrum Master**, a **Product Owner** and **Developers**

- No sub-teams or hierarchies

- Focused on one objective at a time - **Product Goal**

- About 10 or fewer people

- Responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything

##### Developers

- Creating a plan for the **Sprint**, the **Sprint Backlog**

- Adhering to a Definition of Done

- Adjust their plan each day toward **Sprint Goal**

##### Product Owner

- Is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.

- Effective Product Backlog management, which includes:
  
  - Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
  
  - Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items
  
  - Ordering Product Backlog items
  
  - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

- Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others

- Product Owner is one person

##### Scrum Master

- Is accountable for establishing Scrum

- Helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization

- Serves the Scrum Team in several ways:
  
  - Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
  
  - Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done
  
  - Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress
  
  - Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox

- Serves the Product Owner in several ways:
  
  - Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
  
  - Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
  
  - Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
  
  - Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed

- Serves the organization in several ways:
  
  - Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
  
  - Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization
  
  - Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work
  
  - Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams

##### Scrum Events

- The Sprint is a container for all other events

- All events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity

##### Sprint

- The heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value

- New Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint

- Time: from 1 - 4 weeks for each Sprint

- All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints

- A set period of time where all the work is done

##### Sprint Planning

- An event in scrum that kicks off the sprint

- Define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved

- Topics
  
  - **What**: 
    
    - Product Owner describes the objective of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to that goal
    
    - Scrum Team decides what can be done in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to make that happen
  
  - **How**:
    
    - The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal
    
    - The resulting sprint plan is a negotiation between the development team and product owner based on value and effort
  
  - **Who**: Product Owner, the Development Team
    
    - Product Owner defines the goal based on the value that they seek
    
    - The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot deliver that goal
  
  - **Inputs**: Product Backlog
  
  - **Outputs**: Sprint Backlog

- Prepare Sprint Planning:
  
  - The product owner must be prepared, combining the lessons from the previous sprint review, stakeholder feedback
  
  - it’s better to get the team together to review and refine the backlog before

- Set time limit - **timeboxing**
  
  - No more than two hours for each week of the sprint
  
  - Setting a maximum amount of time for the team to accomplish a task, in this case, planning the sprint
  
  - The [scrum master](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-master) is responsible for making sure the meeting happens

- Focus on the outcomes, not the work
  
  - [User stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) are one great way of describing the work from a customer point of view
  
  - **As [type of user], I want [a goal] so that [a reason]**

- Estimates are required but don’t pretend you know more than you do
  
  - requires some level of [estimation](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation)
  
  - The team needs to define what can or cannot be done in the sprint:  estimated effort vs capacity

##### Product Backlog

- the connection between the product owner and the development team

- A prioritized list of work that is derived from roadmap and requirements

- The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first

- The development team pulls work from the product backlog by iteration

- Roadmap initiatives break down into several epics
  
  - Each epic will have several requirements and user stories

- The product owner then organizes each of the user stories into a single list for the development team

- Influence to a Product Owner's prioritization:
  
  - Customer priority
  
  - Urgency of getting feedback
  
  - Relative implementation difficulty
  
  - Relationships between work items (e.g. B is easier if we do A first)

##### Sprint Review

- Not retrospectives, demonstrating the hard work of the entire team: designers, developers, and the product owner

- Step 1: Define 'done'
  
  - Develop a clear culture of how to deliver work as well as what it means to be 'done'
  
  - These questions to assess your process:
    
    - Are stories well-defined by the product owner, designer, and the engineering team before implementation?
    
    - Does everyone understand and live the team’s engineering values and culture?
    
    - Are there clear definitions and requirements around code review, automated testing, and continuous integration to encourage sustainable, agile development?
    
    - After the team completes a story, are there many bugs that surface? In other words, does ‘done’ really mean ‘done?’
  
  - Defining ‘done’ on each work item
    
    - When the product owner adds work to the team’s [backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlogs), defining the acceptance criteria is a key part of his or her process
    
    - **Acceptance criteria**: metrics the product owner uses to confirm the story has been implemented to his or her satisfaction.
    
    - **Testing notes**: short, focused guidance from the quality assistance team that enables the development engineer to write better feature code and automated tests

- Step 2: Celebrate the team
  
  - A great time to celebrate the team and everyone’s accomplishments
  
  - Typically host them on Friday afternoons
  
  - May be Sprint Review doesn’t become a positive activity across the team, because:
    
    - The team taking on too much work and not completing it during an iteration
    
    - The team struggling with existing technical debt
    
    - Features not being developed sustainably
    
    - The team’s development practices aren’t tuned well
    
    - The product owner is changing priorities within an iteration

- Step 3: Reach across geographies

##### Stand-up

- A daily meeting that involves the core team: product owners, developers, and the [scrum master](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-master)

- Three simple questions:
  
  - What did I work on yesterday?
  
  - What am I working on today?
  
  - What issues are blocking me?

-
